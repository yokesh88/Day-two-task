1)write a blog on the difference between document and window object

This blog explores the differences between Document and Window object in JavaScript, focusing on their roles, scopes, and functionalities, as they are 
essential components of the Document Object Model (DOM) for efficient web development.

Window Object:
The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document.The Window object is responsible 
for managing global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows,
such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().

Properties:
/////window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)
/////window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

Methods:

/////window.open() - open a new window
/////window.close() - close the current window
/////window.moveTo() - move the current window
/////window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

Document Object:
The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the web page’s content.
The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform-neutral interface that enables 
dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.
The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document, such as getElementById(), querySelector(), 
createElement(), and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows dynamic updates 
and interactions with web page content.

Properties:
/////element.innerHTML = new html content//Change the inner HTML of an element
/////element.attribute = new value//Change the attribute value of an HTML element

Methods:
/////document.createElement(element//Create an HTML element
/////document.removeChild(element)//Remove an HTML element

Differences between document and window objects: 
Understanding the differences between Window and Document objects is crucial in JavaScript and web development. Window manages browser interactions, while 
Document acts as an interface for content manipulation. Using these functionalities allows developers to create interactive web experiences.
